## Daily Report of Challenges 
Whilst creating the project, there were many difficulties faced and these challenges are recorded on the day of creating and progressing through the project. 

**Day 1**

Today is the first day that I attempt to understand how WordPress operates as well as become fluent in using WordPress. To start off the project, through the aid of the recorded Azure & Cloud Fundamental bootcamp, I was able to create a WordPress without any struggle. However, after a long debate of what type of template I wanted to use for my blog/resume I realised that it was quite difficult to adjust the template to the particular style I wanted without being bound to the template offerred by WordPress. Through vigorous research and tutorial videos found online, I was finally able to adjust the template and create a design that was suited to the type of blog/resume I wanted to create. 

After this process I began to plan out how I wanted to display my content on the blog/resume and began inserting categories and setup menus. It was challenging to figure out how to edit these as I did not realise that there was another page to add and edit content and categories on WordPress. Thus, after browsing various sources, I finally figured out how to create and set up categories and setup menus. This was the end of my first day of creating my own WordPress as after much difficulty, I had discovered how WordPress functions and was confident that I could now input in content on the next day that I work on the project.  


**Day 2**

It is now the second login of creating my project and I have difficulty accessing WordPress. The WordPress was unable to load my website and stated that there was an "internal error" and did not load my website. Whilst waiting for WordPress to load, I began to document the content I want to add to the website on a Word Document so I can add my content in later when my website loads. After the WordPress finally loaded, I decided to add in plugins to improve the performance of my website. Because the website was relatively slow in loading up and sometimes failed, I wanted to add in plugins to make sure that the slow loading was not because of my website. As on the first day my website loaded perfectly fine and fast as well, thus, to ensure that the slow loading of my website might be because of WordPress itself, I added in plugins to eliminate the idea that the slow loading was because of my website. 

As today there may be a possible issue within WordPress, it was difficult to complete a lot of work today as WordPress was very slow to load its own website as well as the website I created with them. This is concluded because all of the other websites used on my internet loaded relatively fast however, only WordPress was slow and sometimes unresponsive. Thus, the purpose of today was to add in Plugins as well as create content so I can post blogs and my resume on the website when I next work on the project. 

**Day 3** 

Finally being able to access WordPress at a faster speed, I was able to efficiently add content into the WordPress. Whilst inputting content, it was difficult to make the content go into the correct category as I did not properly fixed the category issue on Day 1 however, today I was able to fix that issue and was able to add my content into the correct category. 

Today was more of creating content and putting content into the WordPress therefore, there was not much difficulty faced apart from trying to categories the content into the right category as well as creating professional looking content. 

**Day 4**
 
 Today's main goal is to further create a professional design and to improve my wedsite design. Through the use of the plugins I was able to create a fast website by reducing the size of the images inserted into my website as well as maintain traffic that may occur due to malicious users. Today was quite productive as I was able to fully understand the plugins more and was able to create a website run on efficient plugins. 
 
 The redevelopment of my website went well today the only difficulty I faced today was trying to create the featured links as well as trying to place image thumbnails for each post. I was able to complete this task after many challenges through researching and going on the wordpress document website for instructions. 
 
 At this stage, I believe I have almost completed the project. However, to further improve my project, I will further research on different plugins that I could used to create an even more faster and controlled website. Therefore, the next time I work on this project I will be aiming to work on more plugins as well as fine tunning my blog/resume site.


**Day 5**

As noted in my previous report of the day, today I worked on the plugins as well as further developing my blog/resume site. Through vigourous research and much difficulty I found WordFence Security - Firewall & Malware Scan as the best plugin to use for my site. This is because the plugin is able to automatically scan as well as send me a notification through to my email when a malicious user is identified. This includes spams, traffic, malicious comments etc. With the use of this plugin the speed of my website will be faster as well as safe. 

After concluding that WordPress can sometimes be slow to load up through the confirmation of email the MSA team, I have decided to add a plugin that can detect traffic or any malicious users in my site. This plugin will be explained further later in the Plugins section. Therefore, today with the improvement of the speed, I believe it is safe for me to submit my work without stress. 

**Day 6**
Today is the last day I work on my project. After reviewing the content, speed and plugin on my blog/resume site, I have decided to submit my project to MSA today. After many struggles to improve the speed of my WordPress incase WordPress has any internal issues again, I had finally submitted my work. 

Therefore, today I conclude my daily reports of the challenges faced during the creation of this project. 

## Plugins
The list of presented below are the plugins installed in the WordPress website and an explanation will be provided as to why the plugin was choosen.
   
1. **Wordfence Security - Firewall & Malware Scan**
   
   With the use of the plugin, my blog/resume will be much safer to use and will block malicious traffic. It acts as a malware scanner and checks for spams, traffic and malicious codes. This plugin will also alert me if there are any issues with my security as well as scans for content, posts and comments on my website for malicious files. I choose this instead of Akismet Anti-Spam because it was able to do all the functions of Akismet Anti-Spam as well as additional features that Akismet Anti-Spam did not have. This plugin will act as my traffic manager and will check that my website is secure from any form of malicious users making the plugin very ideal to use. 
   
   Wordfence was further chosen to be a plugin in my website because in comparison to Malcare Security because WordFence is a server-side scanner making it more accurate to use than Malcare Security. Though Malcare Security has the necessary functions to identify traffic and malicious content and users, it is not convient to use as the setting are far more complicated and needs to be set properly for the plugin to function as the user wants. Thus, with the easy use of WordFence, I downloaded this for easy access to an accurate plugin that will provide security to my website. 
2. **Asset CleanUP: Page Speed Booster**
   
   Currently my website takes a while to load and star up therefore, with the use of this plugin it will be able to make my site load faster and minimise the amount of HTTP requests, preload CSS/JavaScript files to whilst minifying them as well. When creating a post I can instantly select what I want to reduce and what in the page I want to reduce down or pre-load. For this plugin, I only compressed the javascript because I noticed when I compress the CSS my layout of the blog/resume site changes and therefore, the outcome is not what I wanted. Thus, when I posted on my blog/resume site, the javascript was the only one that was compress. 
   
   This plugin was very useful as I was able to create a faster blog/resume site because the plugin was able to help me reduce down the sizes of my posts which made it very convenient to access. I would recommened this plugin to others as it worked perfectly for my site. 
   
3. **Imagify**

   Imagify is used other than other plugins that help with minimising the sizes of images for the website because it is easier to use and also through the plugin you can choose whether you want to reduce the size of your website as well as the images you want to input on the website. This makes it an ideal plugin to help with reducing the size of the website to help it run faster and smoother. By changing the settings in Imagify, I was able to get the plugin to automatically reduce the sizes of the images I upload onto my website without having to externally compress the images down. This makes it convenient for its users and makes the website faster at the same time. 
   
   Compared to ShortPixel (another Image Optimiser), Imagify is able to convert up to 25mb of images for free and does not cost money before using up the 25mb of images. Moreover, Imagify works on compressing the images uploaded onto the website as to Shortpixel where it converts the image into its fixed category. Therefore, Imagify gives me more of the freedom to compress my images without losing any of its content and size, making it a very ideal plugin to use. 
   
## Choice of Design
Throughout the process of creating this blog/resume site on WordPress, I tried to create a professional looking design whilst merging my personality with it. The website design has a background of white marble and the main header background is with a girl holding a book and coffee. These mostly resemble me the most as I like to read as well as love the elegant look of marble. 

Within each post that I have uploaded, a "Quote of the Day" will be included at the end. I added this in to add my own characteristics to the website whilst trying to maintain professionalism. With the use of the same font on each post, I kept the website looking consistent and easy to navigate around. Each quote used on the posts will be related to the content within the post. This maintains professionalism as well as brings out the character of the creator of the website as well (me). 

By keeping the website consistent with the same format, visitors to the website will be able to be comfortable and have a sense of similarity whilst distinguishing the unique website from others. Rather than over doing the website with random inputs and creativity, I created the website to look elegant and sophisticated to emphasise the professional content within the website. This helps the audience to stay in the website without being distracted or bored of the website. 

Overall, the choice of my design was to keep the website appearing as professional as possible whilst also maintaining my personality within the website. These will help the audience understand better of the content and in addition, also understand the creator of the website better as well. Thus, all of these choices where made for the design. 

## Conclusion

Ultimately, this report was to reflect on the project given by MSA and was to present my understand of the project. By displaying the challenges I faced during the process of creating the blog/resume site through the use of daily reports, I am able to show my development throughout the project and my understanding of WordPress. Through the explanation given of the plugins used for site as well, I am able to present my understanding of plugins as well as the reasonings as to why I needed the plugins. By having these plugins, the website had become much faster and is able to load quicker whilst also tracking traffic in my website. These plugins, helped develope my site and have been used constantly throughout the process of creating this website. 

As a result, I enjoyed the process of creating this project. Though there was much difficulty faced throughout the creation of this project, I was able to develop my website as well as my understanding and experience with WordPress. I hope to further implement this knowledge again sometime in future to demonstrate my strong understanding of WordPress and gain more experiences.
